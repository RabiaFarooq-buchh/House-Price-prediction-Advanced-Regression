# House-Price-prediction-Advanced-Regression
Employing advanced regression techniques such as Ridge and Lasso, we aim to make predictions about house prices.

Surprise Housing, a housing company based in the United States, has made the decision to venture into the Australian market. The company utilizes data analytics to acquire houses at prices lower than their actual value and subsequently sells them at a higher price point. To facilitate this endeavor, the company has compiled a dataset from the sales of houses in Australia, which is available in the 'test.csv' file provided in the repository.

The company is currently in the process of evaluating potential properties for acquisition as a means to enter the market. This repository is dedicated to constructing a regression model incorporating regularization, which will aid in estimating the true value of these prospective properties and consequently assist in the decision-making process of whether or not to invest in them.

The company is interested in understanding:

Which variables play a significant role in predicting house prices?
To what extent do these variables accurately represent house prices?
By utilizing GridSearchCV, the model ultimately determines an optimal lambda value, which is instrumental in the prediction of house prices using ridge and lasso regression.
